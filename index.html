	            <h3> Intrest in IT </h3>
	            <p> My interest in IT started from a young age I had a relative who worked at apple and always had the newest computers and phones, from that young age I was hooked with all things technology. This love continued as I got into high school and was able to study multimedia in my earlier years than during my VCE study software engineering which is when I realised that I wanted to make some sort of career out of it. Despite making the choice to join the army over continuing to study further, my career has lead me into signals and radios which has given me a different experience in networking and IP while also exposing me to how this technologies work and connect.I chose to start studying online at RMIT because I wanted to further my knowledge with in the defence force so that my skill or knowledge didn’t fade. My ultimate goal is once I leave the defence force, to studying software engineering or computer sciences and gain some sort of job in a large commercial business to help create programs  for them. I'm hoping to learn some basic to moderate programming skills that will allow me continue my passion for coding and learn a broad range of IT skills. I also want to have a more in depth and broader understanding of all different areas of IT including Networking, Social medias, application management and any other areas that I don’t already know about.</p>

						              <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
						              <h4>Description</h4>
						              <p>This role for the position  is for a software engineer to join a team of other engineers to maintain and continue to develop a wide range of technologies for the Coles group and its subsidiaries to achieve data driven outcomes This Job is appealing because it mixes the worlds of business  and programming by allowing a team engineers to work together and mix with the commercial side of the Coles group business and develop and maintain their technologies and programs. This job would require you to closely work with the higher management of the Coles group and to put their ideas and needs and turn them into outcomes for the business.
</p>
						              <h4>Skills I have</h4>
						              <p>My skills currently are basic programming skills in python and visual basic.net, with no formal qualifications in any IT related areas. With experiences running IT for a small boutique accounting firm, I do have the understanding of working in an extremely professional environment with many professionals of all different fields and the understanding of combined efforts to achieve client and business based goals.</p>
						              <h4>Skills I Need</h4>
						              <p>The skills needed for this jobs, will be the knowledge of several coding languages which may include python, javascript and c++ but also the ability to pick up and learn new languages as needed. A background in computer sciences or software engineering would be the needed qualifications and experiences in both those fields in any business.
.</p>
						              <h4>Learning Plan</h4>
						              <p>The plan to gain these skills and qualifications over time would involve me continuing to complete my bachelor of IT whist in my current job, to gain the all round skills in the different  IT fields. I would then need to move back to Melbourne where I could take up studying either a bachelor of computer sciences or a bachelor of software engineering for the next 3-4 years. Experiences would be hard to determine how I would gain them, as opportunities always come up in life through social interactions or work related dealings but it will always be important that I put myself out their to business that I am interested in any type of work or any type of experiences I can gain from them in return for my time paid or otherwise.

	            <h1>Personality Tests</h1>
	              <section>
									<h3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h3>
									<h3>Analysis</h3>
									<p>The test results show that I am a confident outgoing person, who likes to take charge in all different types of situations. The results confirm to me the type of person which I already knew myself to be</p>
									<h3>Influence</h3>
									<p>The results of these test influence my behaviour by forcing me to think about how I behave and act in all team settings and give me the ability to focus on bringing as many of my good personality traits to the group while trying not to use traits that are not going to be beneficial.</p>
									<h3>Team Composition</h3>
									<p>When forming a team, all members should have a good understanding of their own personalities. The best groups have a good combination of many different personality types and try their best to avoid having two of the same personality types, especially is they are strong in the assertive category.</p>

            	<h2>Project Idea</h2>

              <h3>Overview </h3>
            	<p> A new type of Eftpos machine or software upgrade for current Eftpos machines that uploads an itemised receipt list (csv file) to your bank when you make a purchase with your credit or debit card (including all type of payWave able devices).</p>
              <h3>Motivation </h3>
              <p>This project would put great power back in the customers hands, with paper receipts only lasting up to several months and the inconvenience of storing large piles of receipts, electronic receipts could greatly improve the customer experience. The project stems from the sms and email receipts that limited business do allow. The customer now would have the convivence of this service with the removed annoyance of entering personal details into business data bases or having to still personally organise electronic recepts.

</p>
              <h3>Potential design ideas/overview</h3>
              <p>The Eftpos machine would be linked up to the point of sale system where when the Eftpos machine created an up link with the bank to verify payment transfer it would send across a compressed csv files from the POS to the bank and then would store the file on a secure file server inside the bank. Inside the server all files would be have a corresponding date and customer file number so that when the banks website server wanted to display the customers purchase file, it is able to search by customer number and then the website will either be able to display that data in multiple different way. Because all the different banks will store the file as a csv, every different bank will be able to use their own creativity and ingenuity to display the customers data in the best way possible. A banks website is outside the scope of this project’s ideas.  </p>
              <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
              <p>Because of the personal nature of the information that will be used and manipulated in this project, security is one of the most important parts of this project. Because most modern Eftpos machine either use 4G or are connected by high speed internet connection bandwidth would not be an issue for security. All data sent up and down the link from the Eftpos machine to which ever bank server it travels to will need to be encrypted with AES256bit encryption. All banks would need to be brought together to agree on the same security protocols so that all different machines can upload data to their servers. The banks file servers would already have extensive security and security infrastructure, this would just need to be tested that it can handle the massive increase in data that they will receive with the csv files and that they have the appropriate hardware and software structure to store the data as well.</p>
              <h3>Skills and team required</h3>
              <p>A project of this size would require a large team of software engineers, business analytes, designers, network engineers and potentially many other professionals and skilled workers to complete these overall tasks. This project would have a large range of stakeholders as well, including the four big banks, the RBA, the federal government, retail companies listed on the ASX 200, the multiple companies that design and produce all types of Eftpos machine and many other smaller stakeholder who hold a valid interest in this project. A timeline for a project like this would be hard to pin down but could potential take multiple years to complete.</p>
              <h3>Potential obstacles</h3>
              <p>On a project this large and complex there are several obstacles needing to be overcome because a team can even start contemplating the project. Funding for a project like this would be the biggest obstacle as it wouldn’t be expected that a customer would pay to opt into this service, so the cost would lie on either three of these stake holders, bank, the government or business. With such a large group of stakeholders, cooperation because a point that could create a lot of issues and potential be an obstacle its self.</p>
